# Exogenous-PHATE (E-PHATE) package

Exogenous-PHATE (E-PHATE) is a method to model the interplay of multi-dimensional, multi-modal measurements from matched samples as a low-dimensional manifold. In our recent paper "Manifold learning uncovers nonlinear interactions between the adolescent brain and environment that predict emotional and behavioral problems," we use E-PHATE to combine children's brain activation with multiple metrics of risk in their environments. These are both high-dimensional, noisy measurements hypothesized to interact in a complex manner and explain variance in mental health, and E-PHATE uncovers low-dimensional manifold structure which improves prediction of mental health outcomes.
